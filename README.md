# RoadScholar
Solves the Road Scholar problem using Floyd Warshall's All-Pairs-Shortest-Path Algorithm.
The input should follow the same example as given in input.txt
The first line should have 3 inputs: num of road-intersections (verticies), num of roads (edges), num of cities (named verticies).
Next there should be a line per edge that has the starting vertex, ending vertex, and distance of that road. 
Next there should be a line per city that has the verticy and city name.
Lastly, input the number of signs to be placed on the roads, and for each sign there should be a line with the starting vertex, ending vertex and distance from the starting vertex.
